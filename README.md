[Coursera Online Machine Learning](https://class.coursera.org/ml-004 "Stanford: Machine Learning 2013")

"By the time you finish this class, you'll know how to apply the most advanced machine learning algorithms to such problems as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building recommender systems, and many other problems. You'll also know how to select the right algorithm for the right job, as well as become expert at "debugging" and figuring out how to improve a learning algorithm's performance."

All of the *problem sets* for the Coursera Online course worked on in Fall 2013.
